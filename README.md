# Cat clicker

This “mini project” is one of my MVVM exercises within the JavaScript Design Patterns course.  This version is coded in KnockoutJS. I used images of cats from a placeholder service. The page displays a list of cats. You can click on each cat’s image while each click is registered. Upon certain amount of clicks of individual cat the status of the cat changes. I also added an admin mode which enables the user to change the source of the picture, name of the cat or number of the clicks.
